  What do you want to be when you grow up?
---
I was lucky to discover my passion for technology in high school.
I am currently learning how that passion intersects with the world around me
while studying both Computer Science and Political Science at Allegheny College in Meadville, PA.

As an effective computer scientist, I possess a love for learning and a desire to explore complex systems. I hope to pursue a career in DevSecOps to concentrate on network security and software development.

However, the answer to the above question is not DevOps Engineer. The answer is servant. My passion for computer science is driven by the oppurtunity to better serve others through creative problem solving.
