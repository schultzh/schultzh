  What do you want to be when you grow up?

I was lucky enough to find my passion for technology in high school. The next steps
seemed simple: get a computer science degree and find a job. But as a junior
studying computer science and political science at Allegheny College, I realize now
it is much more complicated than I once thought.

why i like CS

want a job in DevSecOps

but ultimately want to serve others
