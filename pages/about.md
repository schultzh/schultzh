  What do you want to be when you grow up?

I was lucky to discover my passion for technology in high school. As a junior studying
at Allegheny College, I am learning how that passion intersects with the world around me.

As an effective computer scientist, I possess a love for learning and a desire to explore complex systems. I hope to pursue a career in DevSecOps to combine my interest in both network security and software development.

However, the answer to the above question is not DevOps Engineer. The answer is servant. The driving force behind my passion for computer science is the oppurtunity to better serve others through creative problem solving.

As a member of a software engineering team responsible for developing
Allegheny's Computer Science Department's automated grading tool,
[GatorGrader](https://www.gatorgrader.org), I have been able to serve my peers and faculty.
I am able to see the tool in use in the classroom, gain experience from both the user and
developer side, and watch our improvements help students learn!
Learn more about this tool on [Github](https://github.com/GatorEducator/gatorgrader).
