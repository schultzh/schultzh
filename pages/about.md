I was lucky to discover my passion for technology in high school. As a junior studying
at Allegheny College, I am learning how that passion intersects with the world around me.

As an effective computer scientist, I possess a love for learning and a desire to explore complex systems. I hope to pursue a career in DevSecOps to combine my interest in both network security and software development.

However, the answer to the above question is not DevOps Engineer. The answer is servant. The driving force behind my passion for computer science is the oppurtunity to better serve others through creative problem solving.
