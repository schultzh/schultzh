  What do you want to be when you grow up?

I was lucky to discover my passion for technology in high school. After that, the next steps
seemed simple: earn a computer science degree and find a job. However, as a junior
at Allegheny College, I realize now
it is much more complicated than I once thought.

As an effective computer scientist, I possess a love for learning, a desire to explore complex systems, and
an eagerness for problem solving. I hope to pursue a career in DevSecOps as it combines my interest in network systems and software development.
