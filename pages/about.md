I was lucky to discover my passion for technology in high school.
I am currently learning how that passion intersects with the world around me
while studying both Computer Science and Political Science at Allegheny College in Meadville, PA.

As an effective computer scientist, I possess a love for learning and a desire to explore complex systems. I hope to pursue a career in DevSecOps to concentrate on network security and software development.

However, my ultimate goal is not the become a DevOps Engineer. My passion for computer science is driven by the oppurtunity to better serve others through creative problem solving. Ultimately, I strive to be a servant.
