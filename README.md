# Professional Portfolio Website

This website serves as an information hub for my professional portfolio as a growing student of computer science. It contains a personal statement and links to my resume and current projects.

The webiste url is as follows: https://schultzh.netlify.app


## Built and Deployed with Netlify

**A really simple Jekyll template for creating a fast, static website on Netlify with
a continuous deployment workflow.**

Based on Netlify's [Jekyll + Netlify CMS](https://github.com/netlify-templates/jekyll-netlify-cms) starter template, head over there for more details on deployment and build settings or to get help with setting up Netlify.


### Local Development

Clone this repository and run:

```bash
bundle install
bundle exec jekyll server --watch
```

In case you don't want to install ruby-bundler you can use docker:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

Jekyll will watch your project folder for changes.

Now navigate to [localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000/) to preview the site, and
[localhost:4000/admin](http://localhost:4000/admin) to log into the CMS.

### Bug reports, feature requests, etc

This is an ongoing project and I welcome contributions. Feel free to submit a PR.

If you need any help with setting up Netlify CMS, you can reach out to the Netlify team in the [Netlify CMS Gitter](https://gitter.im/netlify/netlifycms).
