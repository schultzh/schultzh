# Professional Portfolio Website

https://schultzh.netlify.app

This website acts as an information hub for my professional portfolio as a third year computer science student preparing to enter the real world. Content includes a personal statement, my resume, and current projects. More content can and will be added as needed to show growth as a student and computer scientist.

I've connected the site [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/provision/#/a183435052p253376842/admin/streams/table/) to better understand who my website is reaching and help optimize it in the future.


## Built and Deployed with Netlify

**A really simple Jekyll template for creating a fast, static website on Netlify with
a continuous deployment workflow.**

This site was built using Netlify and written in Markdown, HTML, and CSS. Each page has a Markdown file with an associated HTML layout. Features such as buttons and the navigation bar are created with HTML and included in the HTML layout file that corresponds with the page's Markdown file.

Based on Netlify's [Jekyll + Netlify CMS](https://github.com/netlify-templates/jekyll-netlify-cms) starter template, head over there for more details on deployment and build settings or to get help with setting up Netlify.
